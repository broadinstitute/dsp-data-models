# Core Model

This directory contains the RDF definition of the DSP Core Data Model. It also contains example
definitions for tables in the [Jade data repo](https://github.com/DataBiosphere/jade-data-repo) which
are inspired by the Core Model.

**NOTE**: The table definitions tracked here are nothing but minimal examples. The Jade repo requires
every column to be declared up-front in its schema definitions, so it's likely you will need to (at least)
add more columns to each example in order to fully capture your data.
